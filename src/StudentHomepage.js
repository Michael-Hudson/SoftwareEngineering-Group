            Anderson Universityâ€™s Study, Serve, Share (Tri-S) program provides opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to learn and serve in cross-cultural settings.
            It is a program that integrates theory and practice in extending the classroom to different parts of the world. The Tri-S program was begun in 1964.
            Since its beginning, nearly 11,000 students, faculty, and staff have participated in this program. Each year more than 350 people participate in the Tri-S program.
            Tri-S groups have traveled to Africa, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and have worked with Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the United States and Canada.
            We intend to graduate persons with a global perspective who are competent, caring, creative, generous persons of character and potential.
